# üß± General Site Context

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Context

You are an experienced frontend developer,
mobile developer (mainly iOS and hybrid, but also
android), it architect working at ibm; you are
passionate about coding, and another topic you
really like and doing some experimental projects is
computer vision, extended reality and augmented
reality; you are also experimenting and studying
machine learning, data warehouse, generative ai
(with ai workflows and agents/agentic ai), using
Snowflake (and you will do some demo projects with
it), and AWS (where you got two certifications,
the Solution Architect Associate and the AI
Certified Practitioner). You want to create now
your personal website; you already have a domain
(https://lightstimulus.dev) but with dummy content
for now; you want to develop the whole site.

## üß≠ Purpose

The site should be a personal portfolio site.
It should include a home page, personal projects,
a blog and a contact page. The goal of the site is
the classic one of a developer's personal site, to
promote the image, provide a contact point and show
the projects the developer worked and is currently
working on.
Development priorities: maintainable and extensible architecture (‚âà70%)
combined with expressive visual and animation elements (‚âà30%)
to reflect technical depth and creative experimentation.

## üéØ Target Audience

The target audience can be the most wide possible.
They can be recruiters, collaborators, potential client,
potential employers.

## ‚ú® Tone & Personality

Some adjectives that I expect can describe the site
would be: minimal, techy, futuristic but also experimental

## üì£ Key Messages or Tagline

For the hero section, consider that the domain for the
site is lightstimulus.dev. If you combine the first
two letters of light and the last 5 letters of stimulus,
you get "limulus". The limulus (or to be precise a
combination of the limulus and the concept of light) are
the logo of the site. As many (hopefully the majority)
of the personal projects displayed will be about a
topic very interesting to me (augmented/mixed/extended
reality), the light is connected to this topic. The
hero should contain an animation of the text "Light stimulus",
the animated logo of the site, and maybe some taglines.
Initially I will provide an initial version of the logo that you will
use for an initial animation, just to see the effect on the page,
then we will move to the definitive svg and apply the
definitive animation on that one.
In the hero section:

- The hero should be compact like like mxb.dev
- Tagline animation should be typewriter
- Subtle floating/parallax effect for depth (Think: calm, elegant, ‚ÄúApple keynote‚Äù feel.)
- Logo reveal follows a ‚Äúlight passes through‚Äù or ‚Äúillumination sweep‚Äù concept;
  the light sweep effect should be a glow beam.

Here are some analogies between limulus and light I like (in
italian), so that you can get an inspiration for
a tagline from them:

- Vista a pi√π
  piani ‚Äì I suoi dieci occhi percepiscono la luce
  in modi diversi, simile a come AR/MR combina
  prospettive multiple per un‚Äôesperienza completa.
- Adattamento alla luce ‚Äì Gli occhi del limulo si
  adattano a diverse condizioni luminose, proprio
  come AR/MR deve adattarsi a ambienti reali variabili.
- Antico e futuristico ‚Äì Il limulo √® un fossile
  vivente; la luce rappresenta innovazione: insieme
  evocano continuit√† tra passato e futuro.

Also consider these information on the vision of
limulus, both in italian and English, from the
wikipedia page: Vision Limulus has been extensively
used in research into the physiology of vision.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded in 1967
in part for research performed on the horseshoe
crab eye. A large compound eye with monochromatic
vision is found on each side of the prosoma;
it has five simple eyes on the carapace, and
two simple eyes on the underside, just in front
of the mouth, making a total of nine eyes.
The simple eyes are probably important during
the embryonic or larval stages of the organism,
and even unhatched embryos seem to be able to
sense light levels from within their buried eggs.
The less sensitive compound eyes, and the median
ocelli, become the dominant sight organs during
adulthood. In addition, the tail bears a series
of light-sensing organs along its length. Each
compound eye is composed of about 1000 receptors
called ommatidia, complex structures consisting of
upwards of 300 cells. The ommatidia are somewhat
messily arranged, not falling into the ordered
hexagonal pattern seen in more derived arthropods.
Each ommatidium feeds into a single nerve fiber.
Furthermore, the nerves are large and relatively
accessible. This made it possible for electrophysiologists
to record the nervous response to light stimulation
easily, and to observe visual phenomena such as
lateral inhibition working at the cellular level.
More recently, behavioral experiments have
investigated the functions of visual perception in
Limulus. Habituation and classical conditioning to
light stimuli have been demonstrated, as has the use
of brightness and shape information by males when
recognizing potential mates. The retinula
(literally, "small retina") cells of the ommatidium
of the compound eye contain areas from which
membranous organelles of conceivable size
(rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny
microvilli (tiny tubes extending out of the retinula)
that interlock with neighboring retinular cells.
This forms the rhabdom, which contains the dendrite
of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some
microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric
cell is the silkworm moth. Microvilli are composed of
a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of
two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where
the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and
yield five membranes about 15 nm thick. In all
arthropods, there is always a rhabdom below a
crystalline cone, on or near the center of the
ommatidium, and always aligned with the path of
light. At right angles to the length of the
rhabdome are the length of the microvilli, which
are in line with each other. The microvilli are
about 40‚Äì150 nm in diameter.
Visione Il limulo rappresenta un organismo modello
per quanto riguarda gli studi sulla fisiologia
della visione. Il suo apparato visivo √® costituito
da due occhi laterali composti situati in cima al
carapace e 5 occhi semplici sensibili alla luce di
cui due mediani, uno endoparietale e due laterali
rudimentali. Gli occhi composti rappresentano
un'eccezione fra i chelicerati, poich√© nessun'altra
specie appartenente allo stesso subphylum ne
possiede, e vengono utilizzati principalmente per
la localizzazione del partner. Gli occhi mediani
sono sensibili alla luce ultravioletta, oltre a
quella visibile, e insieme agli occhi laterali
rudimentali variano la propria sensibilit√† in base
a segnali inviati dal cervello in relazione a un
orologio interno. Di notte la capacit√† visiva del
limulo arriva ad amplificarsi di un milione di
volte. Una serie di fotorecettori presenti sulla
parte superiore e sui lati del telson inviano
segnali di sincronizzazione al cervello con i cicli
di luce e buio, rafforzati da segnali addizionali
provenienti dai piccoli occhi mediani che aumentano
il grado di adattamento all'oscurit√† in relazione
all'intensit√† di luce ultravioletta. Sul ventre
del limulo, inoltre, sono presenti due occhi,
localizzati vicino alla bocca, che favoriscono
l'orientamento durante il nuoto. Nei due occhi
composti, ciascun ommatidio √® collegato ad una
singola fibra nervosa, molto grande, e ci√≤ ha
consentito lo studio a livello cellulare della
risposta nervosa alla stimolazione. Questi studi,
condotti sui limuli sin dagli anni venti del
ventesimo secolo, hanno permesso l'individuazione
dei meccanismi di funzionamento di fenomeni visivi
come l'inibizione laterale, ovvero la capacit√† di
distinguere linee, forme e contorni degli oggetti.

The animated logo and ‚ÄúLight Stimulus‚Äù text should be SVG-based
Framer Motion animation; the logo and the ‚ÄúLight Stimulus‚Äù text
should be animated as separate reveal for the logo first, then the text.
Propose a few taglines in English and translated into Italian
based on my limulus-light analogies; taglines should cycle automatically
(like a typing effect / fade between phrases). I already have
a SVG file I will provide you later when creating the page.
