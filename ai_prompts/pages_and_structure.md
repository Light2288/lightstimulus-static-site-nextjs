# üìÅ Pages & Site Structure

## üåê Overview

Here is a list of all the pages I am considering for now.
In the future I will probably add a newsletter / mailing list
later (like a small audience-builder), but for now keep things
simple and do not add this page. For the key content, I will
provide what I think should be included, but feel free to suggest
any improvement and additional content, or to remove or modify
some content I considered if this is not a best practice/useful
in your opinion.
The site should at least have an home page, a project page,
a bio/about page, a blog page and a contact page.

| Page     | Purpose / Key Content                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home     | Short intro, featured projects, few of the most recent blog articles                                                                                           |
| About    | Bio, experience, photo is not mandatory; tone of the page should be "colloquial", without direct references to IBM (even if my current job can be cited)       |
| Projects | All portfolio items with filters; Projects page should only showcase personal/experimental projects (computer vision, XR, Snowflake demos, AI workflows, etc.) |
| Blog     | Articles and notes; blog style should be technical deep dives/tutorials (e.g., Gatsby, XR, AI workflows, SwiftUI tips), and short reflections/essays           |
| Contact  | just a simple form and social links                                                                                                                            |

## üß© Global Components

The global component reused across pages should be

- header: should contain the logo, navigation bar to move across
  pages, a search button and a toggle for dark and light switch
- footer: minimal footer with three or four icons for social links
  and the copyright info; in the future maybe i will add an input to
  subscribe to the newsletter
- theme toggle is part of the header
- a layout wrapper already present in the documents
- please suggest any other cross component that could be userful

## üîó Navigation & Routing

Navigation is performed through the menu in the header that exposes
all the available pages, except for the detail page for blog article
and for project details. The header should not be fixed but about
this make your proposal, always thinking in a creative way
The active link in the navbar should be highlighted
